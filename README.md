## Part 1 - Create My Personal Financial Planner

I create my own portfolio for cryptocurrency first, which are bitcoins and ethereum coins. After accessing data through JSON, I calculate the current value for bitcoin and ethereum coins.

I also create another portfolio for stock and bond, SPY and EGG. After accessing data through Alpaca API, I calculte the current value for SPY and EGG.

After that, I make a summary and analysis, my total saving amount is enough to make this investment.

## Part 2 - Create a Financial Planner for Retirement
Using Monte Carlo Simulation to analyze purchasing SPY and AGG depending on different scenarios. 

First scenario, I try to get the total return by weighting 60% stock and 40% bonds for 30 years by 95% confident interval.

Second scenario, I try to get the total return by the same weights for 5 years by 95% confident interval.

Third scenario, I try to get the total return by weighting 80% stock and 40% bonds for 10 years by 95% confident internval.

Based on my calculation, it has risk to retire within 5 years as there is 5% risk that this investment will lose money. It is possible to retire in 10 years and 30 years, this financial plan performs well in 10 years and 30 years according to above weights.
